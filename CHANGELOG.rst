Added X-Caller header param. E.g. x_caller='example_caller' in api call.




Version 2.0.29
==============

Added TSNE analytics to the intent model and its API. See 'examples/intent_classifier.py'.

Added model readonly flag which prevents a model from being modified or a new model of the same name being created.

Added CRF entity extractor.


Version 2.0.28

Specialised the entity extractor response models from entity_model to duckling_entity, person_name_entity, regex_entity and sim_word_entity.


Version 2.0.27
==============

Added more samples to intent classifier to demonstrate cross validation.


Version 2.0.26

Added import and export of models to a feersum_nlu_util.transfer module.


Version 2.0.25
==============

Added the threshold param (that used to be only on intents and FAQs) to the text classifier model.

Add num_training_samples and num_testing_samples to model instance details.

example/intent_classifier.py added example of providing a language hint.


Version 2.0.24
==============

Added mypy, pylint, flake8, coverage and coveralls to dependencies.

- See class 'feersum_nlu.models.sentiment.Sentiment'

Added the vaporise endpoint to permanently delete a model instance whether it is trashed or not.

Version 2.0.21
==============

- Examples of async training.
