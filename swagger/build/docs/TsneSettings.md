# TsneSettings

## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**n_components** | **int** | Dimension of the embedded space. | 
**perplexity** | **float** | The perplexity is related to the number of nearest neighbors that is used in other manifold learning algorithms. Larger datasets usually require a larger perplexity. Consider selecting a value between 5 and 50. The choice is not extremely critical since t-SNE is quite insensitive to this parameter. | [optional] 
**learning_rate** | **float** | The learning rate for t-SNE is usually in the range [10.0, 1000.0]. If the learning rate is too high, the data may look like a ‘ball’ with any point approximately equidistant from its nearest neighbours. If the learning rate is too low, most points may look compressed in a dense cloud with few outliers. If the cost function gets stuck in a bad local minimum increasing the learning rate may help. | [optional]
